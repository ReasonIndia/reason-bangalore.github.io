[Shakthi Kannan](https://twitter.com/shakthimaan) introduced us to how the [ocaml.org](https://ocaml.org) website is built.

You need to first install Opam (OCaml Package Manager) on your system,
and a [demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJf8SeSRZjI) is
available.

The OCaml.org website sources are at
[OCaml.org](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org). After cloning the
repository, you need to run:

```
$ make switch
$ make start
```

A [dashboard](https://github.com/orgs/ocaml-web/projects/1/views/1) of
good-first-issues to contribute to the OCaml.org web project are
available.

We had a casual round of discussion about embedded systems as some of
the attendees write embedded software for a living. Of course,
[mirage.io](https://mirage.io) came up!


## Next meetup: May 19th, 2pm.

We continue where we left off last weekend. You can find the code
repository on [Github
org](https://github.com/ReasonIndia/dream-web-server-sessions). You
can reach out me on X at
[@ManasJayanth](https://twitter.com/ManasJayanth) if you have any
trouble. I recommend you set it up and install the dependencies to
save time during the call :)

Setting up OCaml and Reason tools isn't easy for everyone. Please reach
out to us on Discord if you're lost setting up the tools.
